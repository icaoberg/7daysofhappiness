First try. It sucked. I had the same measurements as the original recipe but I think the white flour I have at home is different. I had to add more flour, unclear if I knead the dough properly. In the end I cut it in half but wasn't enough to cover the pie dish. Or maybe I need to stretch it sooner. Whatever the case maybe, I will consider this test as a failure.

At least I will never be as terrible as this people on the Food Network.
