I have been knitting for the last two days. Knitting is an activity that helps me calm down or reduce anxiety. It is hobby that also helps me focus when attending a workshop or lecture.

So it tried making the hat in the video above. My first attempt was a failure because the loom was too large. The hat was huge. Ended up using it as a tea cozy #ftw.

The second hat turn out fine.

Mental notes

* 4 inches for the rim means 16 rows
* 16 rows more make a perfect hat
* Need to learn how to hide the ending yarn better, but what I can today works just fine
