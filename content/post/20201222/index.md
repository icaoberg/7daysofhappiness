This has been a difficult year for everyone. Including myself. I have been lucky enough to have a job and do my part to aid scientists in their journey of discovery.

However, I also need to take care of myself. I am thinking, what can I do to help me relax and unwind at the end of the year. Tech projects are always cool, but I need something more than that.

I used to write. Should I start writing again? Code more? Who knows, but I need to find a small project to keep me distracted.
