Like I mentioned

# The journey

In a nutshell, a pascualina is dough and a veggie filling.

To veganize the dough you need to replace the butter and/or eggs. There are many recipes out there, but there are several versions that do not use eggs and replace the butter with oil, for example this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uCOu2l1vp8&t=163s&ab_channel=PaulinaCocina).

So I will do that one. That was easy. It's basically oil, flour and water.

To veganize the filling I need to avoid using eggs and dairy. Avoiding the whole egg is easy. But I do need a binder. Most people either use eggs, ricotta cheese or a béchamel sauce as binder.
